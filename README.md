**SOC Use Cases &amp; Playbooks**

This repository provides an open and community-friendly library of SOC detection use cases and incident response playbooks. It aims to help blue teams, threat hunters, and SOC analysts quickly adopt proven detections, understand log source requirements, and follow structured response steps for common threats.

Each detection includes explanations, sample logs, prerequisites, and tuning recommendations, while playbooks provide step-by-step response workflows that can be adopted by any organisation. Content covers Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure Sentinel, Sysmon/Sigma rules, and generic SIEM-agnostic patterns.

The goal is to create a comprehensive, vendor-neutral repository that the global SOC community can improve over time. Contributions of new analytic rules, incident types, and optimised response flows are welcome.
